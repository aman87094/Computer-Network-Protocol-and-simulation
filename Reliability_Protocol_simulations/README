Files Included :
1. sender.py     - takes 1 extra argument for protocol
2. receiver.py   - takes 1 extra argument for Imange filename
3. evaluate.sh   - run in bash 
4. CS3205_A3.pdf - analysis for the observations
5. HeatMaps Folder with output_SW.png, output_GBN.png, output_SR.png
6. Spreadsheets Folder containing the values we got after running the script.

For running Once:
    Run sender.py with argument as the keyword for the protocol required.
    ("SW","GBN","SR" -> self explanatory)
    Run receiver.py with argument as the name of file(image) where the final image is to be stored. 

For running with Bash:
    The bash script is made such that we have to edit the protocol each time before running.
    ("SW","GBN","SR" -> self explanatory)  
    These keywords are needed to be changed and the script will run the sender and receiver codes 6*6=36 times for each value of latency and loss.


Note:
Some print statements are not commented in the receiver code so that we can see how the packets are sent and when re-transmitted.
Comment out those print statements if as required. 

Note:
The bash is made such that it would apply tc netem on lo.
This can be changed as required. Use the command ifconfig to get all options.
